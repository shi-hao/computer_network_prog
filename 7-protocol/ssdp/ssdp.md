# Simple Service Discovery Protocol  
The Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) is a network protocol based on  
the Internet protocol suite for advertisement and discovery of network  
services and presence information. It accomplishes this without assistance of  
server-based configuration mechanisms, such as Dynamic Host Configuration  
Protocol (DHCP) or Domain Name System (DNS), and without special static  
configuration of a network host. SSDP is the basis of the discovery protocol  
of Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) and is intended for use in residential or  
small office environments. It was formally described in an Internet  
Engineering Task Force (IETF) Internet Draft by Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard  
in 1999. Although the IETF proposal has since expired (April, 2000),[1] SSDP  
was incorporated into the UPnP protocol stack, and a description of the final  
implementation is included in UPnP standards documents.[2][3]  
  
SSDP is a text-based protocol based on HTTP. It uses UDP as the underlying  
transport protocol. Services are announced by the hosting system with  
multicast addressing to a specifically designated IP multicast address at UDP  
port number 1900. In IPv4, the multicast address is 239.255.255.250[4] and  
SSDP over IPv6 uses the address set ff0X::c for all scope ranges indicated by  
X.[5]
