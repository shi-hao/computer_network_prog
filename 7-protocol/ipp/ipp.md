# Internet Printing Protocol  
The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is a specialized Internet protocol for  
communication between client devices (computers, mobile phones, tablets, etc.)  
and printers (or print servers). It allows clients to submit one or more  
print jobs to the printer or print server, and perform tasks such as  
querying the status of a printer, obtaining the status of print jobs, or  
cancelling individual print jobs.  
  
Like all IP-based protocols, IPP can run locally or over the Internet.  
Unlike other printing protocols, IPP also supports access control,  
authentication, and encryption, making it a much more capable and secure  
printing mechanism than older ones.  
  
IPP is the basis of several printer logo certification programs including  
AirPrint, IPP Everywhere,[1] and Mopria Alliance, and is supported by over  
98% of printers sold today.[2]   
  
IPP is implemented using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and inherits  
all of the HTTP streaming and security features.  
  
Among other things, IPP allows a client to:  
  
    query a printer's capabilities (such as supported character sets, media  
			types and document formats)  
    submit print jobs to a printer  
    query the status of a printer  
    query the status of one or more print jobs  
    cancel previously submitted jobs  
IPP uses TCP with port 631 as its well-known port.
