# RTSP
real time streaming protocol is used for establishing and controlling media sessions between end points.  
Clients of media servers issue VHS-style commands, such as play, record and pause, to facilitate real-time  
control of the media streaming from the server to a client (Video On Demand) or from a client to the  
server (Voice Recording).  

The transmission of streaming data itself is not a task of RTSP. Most RTSP servers use the Real-time  
Transport Protocol (RTP) in conjunction with Real-time Control Protocol (RTCP) for media stream delivery.  
However, some vendors implement proprietary transport protocols.  

Like HTTP,RTSP uses TCP to maintain an end-to-end connection.
